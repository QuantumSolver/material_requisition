# Memory Leak Fixes for Promep Create Request

## Overview
This document outlines the memory leak issues identified in the `promep/create-request` functionality and the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve them.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Fetch Requests Without Proper Cleanup
**Problem**: Multiple fetch requests in `CreateRequest.vue` and `ItemSelector.vue` were not properly aborted when components unmounted, leading to memory leaks.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented `safeFetch` utility with automatic cleanup
- Added abort controllers to all fetch requests
- Proper cleanup in `beforeUnmount` lifecycle hooks

### 2. Reactive Data Mutations
**Problem**: Direct mutations of arrays and objects caused memory retention and potential circular references.

**Solution**:
- Used `splice()` method to clear arrays without reassigning references
- Created clean objects without circular references in `addItem()` method
- Proper bounds checking for array operations

### 3. Component State Persistence
**Problem**: Component state persisted between route changes, causing memory accumulation.

**Solution**:
- Comprehensive state cleanup in `beforeUnmount` hooks
- Clear all component data properties
- Reset to initial state before navigation

### 4. Router Memory Issues
**Problem**: Router guard was forcing garbage collection but not handling cleanup properly.

**Solution**:
- Moved garbage collection to `afterEach` guard
- Added development-only garbage collection
- Proper cleanup timing with setTimeout

### 5. Missing Memory Tracking
**Problem**: No visibility into memory usage and leak detection.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive memory tracking utilities
- Added component instance tracking
- Fetch request and timer tracking
- Development-mode memory reporting

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/views/CreateRequest.vue`
- Added abort controller for fetch cleanup
- Implemented memory tracking mixin
- Enhanced `beforeUnmount` cleanup
- Used `safeFetch` for API calls
- Proper state clearing before navigation

### 2. `src/components/ItemSelector.vue`
- Added memory tracking mixin
- Enhanced array mutation handling
- Improved `addItem()` method to prevent circular references
- Added bounds checking for array operations
- Used `safeFetch` for API calls

### 3. `src/main.ts`
- Improved router guards
- Added `afterEach` guard for cleanup
- Development-only garbage collection
- Better timing for cleanup operations

### 4. `src/utils/memoryUtils.js` (New File)
- Comprehensive memory tracking system
- `safeFetch` wrapper with automatic cleanup
- Enhanced timer functions
- Vue mixin for automatic component tracking
- Development-mode memory reporting

## Memory Tracking Features

### Component Tracking
- Automatic tracking of component instances
- Logging of mount/unmount events
- Detection of component leaks

### Fetch Request Tracking
- Automatic abort controller management
- Request lifecycle tracking
- Cleanup of pending requests

### Timer Tracking
- Safe timer creation and cleanup
- Prevention of timer leaks
- Automatic cleanup on component unmount

### Memory Reporting
- Real-time memory usage reports
- Development-mode logging
- Global memory tracker access

## Usage

### For Developers
1. Import memory utilities: `import { safeFetch, memoryTrackingMixin } from '../utils/memoryUtils.js'`
2. Add mixin to components: `mixins: [memoryTrackingMixin]`
3. Use `safeFetch` instead of `fetch`
4. Access memory tracker in development: `window.memoryTracker`

### Memory Reports
In development mode, memory reports are logged every 30 seconds showing:
- Active component instances by type
- Number of pending fetch requests
- Number of active timers
- Timestamp of report

## Testing Memory Fixes

### Before Fixes
- Navigate to create-request multiple times
- Observe increasing memory usage
- Pending fetch requests accumulating
- Component instances not being cleaned up

### After Fixes
- Memory usage remains stable
- Fetch requests properly aborted
- Component instances properly tracked and cleaned
- No accumulation of resources

## Development Tools

### Memory Tracker Console Commands
```javascript
// Get current memory report
window.memoryTracker.getMemoryReport()

// Log detailed memory report
window.memoryTracker.logMemoryReport()

// Clean up all resources
window.memoryTracker.cleanup()

// Abort all pending requests
window.memoryTracker.abortAllRequests()
```

### Browser DevTools
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to Memory tab
3. Take heap snapshots before/after navigation
4. Compare memory usage patterns

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Always use abort controllers** for fetch requests
2. **Clear arrays with splice()** instead of reassignment
3. **Implement proper cleanup** in beforeUnmount hooks
4. **Use memory tracking mixins** for all components
5. **Avoid circular references** in data objects
6. **Clean state before navigation** to prevent accumulation
7. **Use development-mode monitoring** for early detection

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead** in production
- **Enhanced debugging** in development
- **Proactive leak prevention** vs reactive fixes
- **Automatic cleanup** reduces manual effort

## Future Considerations

1. Consider implementing memory budgets
2. Add automated memory leak testing
3. Extend tracking to other resource types
4. Implement memory usage alerts
5. Add performance metrics collection

## Conclusion

These comprehensive fixes address all identified memory leak sources in the create-request functionality. The implementation provides both immediate fixes and long-term monitoring capabilities to prevent future memory issues.
